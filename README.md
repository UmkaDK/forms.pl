Forms In Perl
=============

**Status:** Fully functional, but missing tests.

A collection of scripts designed for dealing with form submissions:

  - **form-validator.cgi** - designed to take a submitted form, validate it according to a set of rules and either forward form submission to another url or redisplay the form in a browser, highlighting fields that could not be validated.

  - **form2mail.cgi** - designed to receive data submitted by a form, validate that data against a set of pre-configured rules, and send out a pre-formatted email message upon successful validation of the data.
